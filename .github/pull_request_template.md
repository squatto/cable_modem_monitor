<!--
Before opening — gating rule:

- Catalog work (new modem, HAR fixtures, parser.yaml): the encouraged path. Claude Code: /modem-intake; other AI tools: load skills/modem-intake.md as context.
- Bug fixes / documented-feature work / small scoped changes: proceed directly.
- Core changes (packages/cable_modem_monitor_core/): start a Discussion regardless of size.
  Link the Discussion + regression tests + golden files + real-modem evidence.
- New features, sensors, architecture, workflow/doc proposals: link a Discussion first.

PRs without a prior Discussion may be closed in favor of starting one.
See CONTRIBUTING.md § Before You File / § What Happens After You File.

Reviews happen on weekends, about two weeks each, one active PR per
contributor. See SUPPORT.md.
